A committee designed to address questions of inclusion and diversity forms. Students cannot change the system for reports of gender-based misconduct and discrimination itself, or the fact that many don’t trust it."},{"type":"text","value":"They can only hope that they’ve created infrastructure in their department that can prevent this from happening again. And that if it happens again, that the department would address it adequately. But would things be different now?"},{"type":"text","value":"“Absolutely not,” says a graduate student in the Neurobiology and Behavior graduate program, who was granted anonymity due to fear of retaliation. The late Dr. Thomas Jessell was terminated in the spring of 2018 due to a violation of the school’s consensual relationship policy."},{"type":"text","value":"“No,” says Rebecca Glade, former president of the Graduate History Association and graduate student in the history department, where former professor William Harris retired from in the fall of 2017 following multiple allegations of sexual assault and harassment. “...I don’t believe they would handle it adequately.”"},{"type":"text","value":"“The hierarchies embedded in the department and in the university make it very difficult for the committee these initiatives to do very much,” Glade later adds. “And part of that I blame on a centralized university administration system.”"}],"part0":[{"type":"text","value":"<i>Sources in this story referred to by first name only have been granted pseudonyms due to fears of retaliation."},{"type":"text","value":"</i>"},{"type":"text","value":"In the Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action’s second annual report, which was released in late October, they revealed that of 55 reports of sexual harassment they had receieved last year, only three respondents were found in violation of their policy.

Davidson felt almost certain that colleagues had known the accused had a pattern. Maybe some didn’t, she says, maybe some students knew more. But she set out with a question for students at her university, Columbia: “What are the things that I don’t know about that I <i>should know about</i>.” She spoke with “a lot of people”—it must have been thirty or so current and former graduate students.

If we’re serious about ending harassment, we need this mechanism,” a university spokesperson says in a written statement to <i>The Eye.</i> They mention that legal and regulatory obligations are at play."}],"sectionhed2":"Departments","part2":[{"type":"text","value":"In October 2017, just three days before the New York Times broke decades worth of sexual harassment allegations against film producer <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html\">Harvey Weinstein</a>, they published another story."},{"type":"text","value":"William Harris, then a prominent professor in the Department of History, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/02/nyregion/columbia-student-sexual-harassment-lawsuit.html?module=inline\">had been sued</a>, facing <a href=\"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2017/10/03/doctoral-student-sues-columbia-over-alleged-sexual-harassment-by-professor/\">allegations of sexual harassment</a> by a former doctoral student."},{"type":"text","value":"Many faculty and students in the department found out through the <i>Times </i>story, says Professor Frank Guridy.
